- 👋 Hello. I am Mauricio Lopez-Soto, father of 3 boys, husband of one woman, software developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in cycling, cooking and good craft beer. I also like working on research projects.
- 🌱 I’m learning how to live more in the moment. I am also learning about AWS. Then I want to learn about reactive programming and get better at functional programming.
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate on projects with a social component. I know all open source projects kind of meet this criteria.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauriciolopezsoto/
